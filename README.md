# PepeClassifier


Swindlers are flooding the market with fake Pepe, and it's time we do something about this.

Created using the Google Codelab guide, this image classifier has a test accuracy of 86% in categorising your pepe into one of the following market categories :fake Laughing Pepe, Angry Pepe, Crying Pepe, Rare Pepe

Docker

**How**

Transfer learning allows you to apply the learning of a fully trained model for a new set of categories. The results are impressive for most applications, and the task does not require them GPUs.

**Steps**
---

1. Download Pepe images to train the network (I used about ~1000 images from google & rare-pepe dot com).
2. Create distinct categories (eg laughing pepe, crying pepe)
3. Retrain the network on these images
4. Test it against the new Pepes on the market
